    "Sentence = \"\"\"After about 145h (most of them from before the game was released on Steam), I have, at long last, completed the main campaign, story DLC, and epilogue. And so only one question remains: Is Valhalla a good Assassin’s Creed game?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, no. It is fundamentally not an Assassin’s Creed game – Valhalla is about AC as much as, say, Skyrim is about racism. Yes, it has some of that, no, it isn’t what the game is about. Eivor, the protagonist, vehemently refuses to join the Assassins for the entirety of the game though they still hunt down the proto-Templars (aka the Order of the Ancients) because … Hytham asked nicely? Well, I guess, why not.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not to say Ubi didn’t *try* to make it an AC game. There are plenty of nods and references, scenery reminiscent of the Ezio trilogy and AC III (Tombs of the Fallen!), and they brought back familiar faces in the modern day segment – sort of. You see, there is a character called “Shaun” who looks deceptively like a character of the same name from earlier AC games and even has the same VA, but where Shaun used to be a hilarious snarky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (and my favourite character), this weird new clone is just kinda there to be friendly and helpful and utterly devoid of personality. Thanks, I hate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing that astonished me about the game was how perfectly bland it is. I wouldn’t say the story is bad, necessarily – except for the various endings, those were pretty awful – but it also isn’t memorable by any stretch of the imagination. Many reviewers before me have lamented the pointless, bloated, meandering quest lines about conquering England so it suffices to say here that I agree wholeheartedly. It was a boring slog and the payoff was minimal. As the protagonist, Eivor had their moments - I certainly enjoyed them always being the voice of reason - but ultimately there was no growth whatsoever and the character remained as bland as the rest of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gameplay loop gets tired fast. Because stealth feels off – enemies are either complete morons or they can spot you from across the camp with no line of sight – I mostly murdered my way through the game in melee combat, mashing buttons. I figured since I am not playing an assassin anyway there was no point in bothering with frustrating stealth mechanics - not to mention that it would also be completely out of character for Eivor who very clearly said they consider stealth cowardly. Why are they the protagonist in an AC game again? Anyway, after a couple of hours, you have seen all the finisher animations in combat which then just become boring to watch over and over again. I was not a fan of AC Odyssey, but I have to say its stealth and combat were definitely better than Valhalla’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game’s redeeming factor is its visual quality. It’s just straight-up gorgeous and a big part of why I finished it is because I wanted to see new, pretty environments. On my (fairly high-end) system, the game ran like a dream at solid 60FPS – at least until the next crash because, oh boy, this game is extremely unstable. It crashes all the time. This happens in addition to a colourful assortment of minor and major bugs which, two years after release, are still commonplace. In a full-price game with a ludicrously expensive ingame MTX shop. That takes balls, Ubi.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DLC were more of the same for the most part. Wrath of the Druids resembled the main campaign in how completely forgettable it was while Siege of Paris at least made an effort to be a bit more cinematic. I absolutely loved Paris and exploring the sewers underground, it was the first time I felt like I was playing an AC game. The focus on assassination missions helped though again it seemed completely out of character for Eivor. Nevertheless, I wore Basim’s robes for the entire DLC and pretended I was there to solve a difficult situation as an assassin. Putting the “role-playing” into RPG and all that. SoP was definitely diminished by a completely pointless “rebel mission” system which was neither tied into the DLC main quest nor became otherwise relevant at any point in the DLC. They didn’t even try to conceal the fact that it was added as busywork to stretch the playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, AC Valhalla – just like AC Odyssey – cannot possibly be called an Assassin’s Creed game. As a Norse vikingr RPG, it was alright and if you like riding through pretty scenery while casually checking off forgettable missions, side quests, and various collectables without any challenging gameplay or complex stories, then you may well enjoy this game. I definitely enjoyed AC Valhalla sometimes, for an hour here or there. Overall, it was still a massive waste of my time and I hope the trend of bloated-games-unrelated-to-AC is over with this pointless entry into the series.\n",
