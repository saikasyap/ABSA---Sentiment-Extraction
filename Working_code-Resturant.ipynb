    "Sentence = \"\"\"Even though I didn't frequent them all that often while they were still here, for quite a while, Buzz was my go-to spot for a tasty burger on this side of SF.  It wasn't amazing, nor the best value (Super Duper takes that distinction), but there was so much to like - friendly staff, plenty of parking, nary a wait, and, most importantly, the burgers were just solid.  So, needless to say, it was a bummer when I passed by and saw that they were gone.  Too bad I took such a long time to finally come here and check out their replacement.  If I hadn't, I would've discovered that even though Buzz may be gone, Native Burger really isn't all that different!\n",
    "\n",
    "While their facade and aspects of their interior have changed (gone is the bench seating, replaced in favor of three picnic tables), not much about Native is all that different from its predecessor.  The menu, in particular, might look all too familiar; like Buzz's, it also not very extensive (though it does have a few more options) and some of the burgers even bear the same name, such as the Western and Sunrise.  However, their dozen or so burgers, as well as their handful of sides, sausages, salad, and loco moco, are rather appealing.  What's more, they have quite a few substitute options, if needed (non-Gluten bun, Lettuce Wrap, and non-beef proteins, like Beyond, Chicken, and Turkey).\n",
    "\n",
    "-- ONION RINGS...$4.25\n",
    "(yelp.com/biz_photos/nati…)\n",
    "These aren't the best I've had, but after not having legit onion rings in ages, I thought these were terrific!  The rings were crispy, not overly battered, and were cut fairly thick.  It doesn't come with dipping sauce, but they happily gave me a side of ranch for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- NATIVE BURGER - 7oz Harris Ranch Grass Fed Beef, 4oz Applewood Smoked \"Fool's Gold\" Bacon, Sunny Farms Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato, and House BBQ Sauce on a Brioche Bun...$15.75\n",
    "(yelp.com/biz_photos/nati…)\n",
    "More solid than spectacular, but still quite tasty!  The patty was well cooked, I LOVED the bacon's salty sweetness, and everything complemented each other really well.  That being said, whether it be due to the patty, the bacon, or both, the burger, as a whole, felt a little greasy.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- JR. CLASSIC BURGER & FRIES - 4oz Harris Ranch Grass Fed Beef, Sunny Farms Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Pringle Cut Dill Pickles, and House Island Sauce on a Brioche Bun with Twice Fried Fries...$11.25\n",
    "(yelp.com/biz_photos/nati…)\n",
    "This was...pretty awesome.  Not only is the burger the perfect size, but it was done so well - juicy patty, a soft, toasted bun, and fresh veggies.  As for the fries, they were far better than the garlic version.  All together, this feels like a terrific value for what you get!\n",
    "\n",
    "-- GARLIC FRIES...$4.50\n",
    "(yelp.com/biz_photos/nati…)\n",
    "Meh.  These fries were also very crispy, and the portion was decent, but the taste was underwhelming.  Not only was it not very garlicky/lacking in garlic, but there wasn't much else to it either - no herbs, no cheese, not much seasoning.  It has potential, but disappointed as is.\n",

    "-- LOCO MOCO - Two Range Free Eggs, 7oz Grass Fed Harris Ranch Beef, and Housemade Gravy Over Jasmine Rice...$12.25\n",
    "(yelp.com/biz_photos/nati…)\n",
    "Are they to blame for this one or am I for ordering it?  Not surprisingly, the patties were the best part, as they were both juicy and flavorful.  Everything else, other then the eggs, was a bust - the onions were mealy, the rice was hard, and the gravy was gloppy and broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of what I've had has been more good than bad, the service here has been excellent all around.  Every time I've stopped in, the same two guys have been working the register and grill and they've always been super friendly.  They've happily given us ranch for the onion rings and garlic fries (much needed for the latter) and they're quick to greet people/say goodbye as folks come and go.  Tasty burgers, friendly service, and a wealth of parking nearby?  Super Duper's newest outpost is a short walk away, but it's great  to know that Native is just as good as my former go-to spot!\"\"\""
